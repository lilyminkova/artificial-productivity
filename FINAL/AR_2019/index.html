				<p>In a study in which participants were given doses of methamphetamine and d-amphetamine, it was found they had very similar experiences. The main difference between methamphetamines and prescription stimulants  is the <span class="bold">method of consumption</span>. Adderall is swallowed and must be processed by the liver before it reaches the bloodstream, while meth is often injected, smoked, or snorted, which results in a much faster and more potent high. This distinction and their potential for abuse is why Adderall sits is a <span class="bold">Class II regulated substances alongside cocaine and heroin </span>.</p>

			Today, America is one of the most prolific prescribers of ADD medications, meaning that they also have one of the highest numbers of ADD diagnosis. <span>Innovation is given such a high priority that it pushes people to their limits, while doctors are also quicker to prescribe drugs as a band aid solution. </span></p>

			It’s now normalized to think of oneself as human capital when the goal is more money and better performance. It can be so effective to take it in that moment that some even regard it as cheating, and taking it recreationally in an athletic context can have you expelled from the league. But in some ways, taking Adderall has become so normalized that some see it as no different than using other, more socially acceptable study aids, like drinking coffee or hiring a tutor. If <span>“it has zero impact on anyone else, and for that reason [it’s not] unfair or unethical.”</span> This mentality that showcases the extreme relation between productivity and a person’s sense of self-worth. Being burnt out or unable to handle your workload are often unacceptable excuses: you have to be able to make it through hard times to <span>succeed at any cost.</span>
